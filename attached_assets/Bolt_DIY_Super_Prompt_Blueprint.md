# **Bolt DIY Enhanced – Super Prompt Blueprint**

## **1. System Architecture Overview**

The system architecture is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, following best practices in React and TypeScript. The core components include the **UI Layer**, **AI Orchestration Layer**, **Persistent Storage System**, and **Security**. Each layer is self-contained and interacts with others through clearly defined interfaces. Redundancy is ensured with **dual cloud synchronization** (GitHub + OneDrive), providing backup and cloud storage capabilities.

### **Key System Layers**

- **UI Layer**: React-based components for managing the user interface and displaying real-time information (e.g., chat interface, project status).
- **AI Orchestration Layer**: Handles multiple AI agents (e.g., Coder, Debugger, WCAG Auditor) and models, routing requests to the appropriate model (local or cloud) based on context.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses IndexedDB/LocalForage for client-side data and cloud backups for project persistence.
- **Security**: Implements hardware-bound encryption, OAuth token management, and continuous vetting of dependencies.

---

## **2. Core Enhancements**

### **A. Persistent Storage System**

**Task**: Implement persistent storage solutions for client-side and cloud synchronization.

- **IndexedDB / LocalForage**: Store user data and project state.
  - Automatically create JSON snapshots every 15 minutes.
  - Support for **dual cloud sync** (GitHub + OneDrive).
  - Version history and timestamped backups.

- **Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted with **AES-256** (for local storage) and **RSA** (for cloud backups).
  - **Backup Matrix**:
    - **Local (IndexedDB)**: Continuous, JSON + Binary, 30 days retention.
    - **GitHub**: On Commit + Hourly, Git Snapshot, Infinite retention.
    - **OneDrive**: Daily + Manual, Encrypted ZIP, 90 days retention.
    - **20i Vault**: On Publish, System Image, 7 days retention.
  
**AI Agent Integration**: Ensure the backup system is integrated with the AI agents for project state syncing.

---

### **B. AI Orchestration Layer**

**Task**: Design a multi-agent AI orchestration system that efficiently routes tasks to the appropriate agents based on project context.

- **Multi-Agent Workflow**:
  - Agents: **Coder**, **Debugger**, **WCAG Auditor**.
  - Routing: AI tasks should be routed based on agent type (e.g., debugging tasks to the Debugger agent).
  - **Model Routing**: AI models will be routed based on context, such as using local models (e.g., Tabby) or cloud models (e.g., GPT-4).
  
- **Contextual Memory**:
  - Maintain project context (e.g., files, history, configuration).
  - Context-aware routing for multi-agent workflows (Coder ↔ Debugger ↔ WCAG).

**Example Prompt**:
- "Route this task to the **Debugger** agent using **GPT-4** as the model. Include the current project state, including the files and conversation history."

---

### **C. Backup System & Data Integrity**

**Task**: Ensure that backups are validated, secure, and recoverable.

- **Backup System**:
  - Implement checksum validation for all backup restores.
  - Enforce a **three-step confirmation process** for overwriting backups.
  - Automate consistency checks for all backup targets.

**Recovery Protocol**:
- **Detection**: Monitor system health with heartbeat and checksum anomaly detection.
- **Response**: Isolate corrupted data, rollback to the last valid state, and notify the user.
- **Restoration**: Gradual reintegration of state with a post-mortem analysis.

---

## **3. Code Templates and Implementation Specifications**

### **A. WebContainer Integration**

**Task**: Integrate **WebContainers** to allow secure in-browser code execution.

- **Goal**: Implement a service that boots WebContainers, installs dependencies, and executes commands (e.g., running a Node.js script).
  
**Example Code**:
```typescript
class WebContainerService {
  private container: WebContainer | null = null;

  async executeCommand(cmd: string): Promise<{stdout: string, stderr: string}> {
    if (!this.container) await this.boot();
    const process = await this.container.spawn(cmd.split(' ')[0], cmd.split(' ').slice(1));
    // Handle command output and return
  }
}
```

---

### **B. CRDT Sync Protocol**

**Task**: Implement a CRDT-based synchronization service for real-time collaboration.

- **Goal**: Ensure that multiple users can edit a project simultaneously without conflict, using **Yjs** and **Websocket** for synchronization.

**Example Code**:
```typescript
import * as Y from 'yjs';
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket';

const ydoc = new Y.Doc();
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('wss://your-websocket-server', 'room-name', ydoc);
```

---

### **C. Hardware-Bound Encryption**

**Task**: Implement **hardware-bound encryption** for local data storage.

- **Goal**: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-GCM** before being written to disk, and can only be decrypted with hardware-backed keys.

**Example Code**:
```typescript
async function generateEncryptionKey(): Promise<CryptoKey> {
  return await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
    true, // extractable
    ['encrypt', 'decrypt']
  );
}
```

## **4. Test Plans for Enhanced Features**

### **A. WebContainer Integration Test Plan**

**Goal**: Ensure that the WebContainer integration functions as expected across various scenarios.

- **Tests**:
  - **Unit Tests**:
    - Validate container initialization and execution of commands.
    - Test file operations (e.g., readFile, writeFile).
  - **Integration Tests**:
    - Test running a Node.js script inside WebContainer.
    - Measure container initialization and command execution time.
  - **Edge Cases**:
    - Simulate WebContainer failures (e.g., network issues).
    - Test handling of long-running processes.

---

### **B. Backup System Validation**

**Goal**: Ensure data integrity and recovery for backup systems.

- **Tests**:
  - **Unit Tests**:
    - Validate backup creation and restore processes.
    - Verify checksum validation during restore.
  - **Performance Tests**:
    - Test backup times for large projects.
    - Measure sync times for GitHub and OneDrive.

---

### **C. AI Response Consistency**

**Goal**: Ensure the AI agents generate consistent and accurate responses.

- **Tests**:
  - Test Coder, Debugger, and WCAG agents using predefined prompts.
  - Validate that responses align with project context and suggested actions.
  - Ensure that each agent returns actionable suggestions (e.g., code changes, debugging fixes, accessibility improvements).
