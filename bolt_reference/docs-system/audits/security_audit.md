# Security Audit Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security audit process, findings, and recommendations for the Documentation System. Security audits are conducted to identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with security standards, and protect sensitive information.

## Security Audit Scope

The security audit covers:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User authentication mechanisms
   - Permission models and access control
   - Session management

2. **Data Security**
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Sensitive information handling
   - Database security

3. **API Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting and abuse prevention
   - API authentication

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Server configuration
   - Network security
   - Deployment practices

5. **Dependency Security**
   - Third-party library vulnerabilities
   - Supply chain security
   - Dependency update practices

## Audit Methodology

The security audit employs these methods:

1. **Automated Scanning**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Container scanning

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review for security issues
   - Architecture review
   - Configuration review

3. **Compliance Verification**
   - Industry standard compliance checks
   - Internal security policy compliance
   - Documentation review

## Recent Audit Findings

The most recent security audit revealed:

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- None identified

### High Severity Vulnerabilities
- API rate limiting bypass in document creation endpoint
- Insufficient input validation in search functionality

### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities
- Session timeout settings not consistently enforced
- Outdated encryption libraries in file storage module
- Missing CSRF protection on some form submissions

### Low Severity Vulnerabilities
- Documentation containing sensitive configuration examples
- Verbose error messages potentially revealing system information
- Insecure default configurations in development environment

| CSRF protection | Medium | In Progress | Web Team | April 22, 2025 |
| Documentation | Low | Completed | Documentation Team | April 5, 2025 |
| Error messages | Low | Scheduled | Error Handling Team | May 5, 2025 |
| Default configurations | Low | Completed | DevOps Team | April 8, 2025 |

## Security Controls Implementation

The Documentation System implements these security controls:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control
- JWT with short expiration for API authentication
- Regular session invalidation

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- PII anonymization in logs and debugging output
- Data classification and handling policies

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting based on user and IP address
- Request size limitations
- API versioning with deprecation strategy

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular OS patching and updates
- Network segmentation
- Web Application Firewall implementation
- Database access restrictions

## Security Monitoring

Ongoing security monitoring includes:

1. **Real-time Alerts**
   - Authentication failures
   - Unusual access patterns
   - API abuse detection
   - System integrity monitoring

2. **Regular Scanning**
   - Weekly vulnerability scanning
   - Daily dependency security checks
   - Continuous infrastructure scanning

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Security events logging
   - Access logs retention
   - Administrative action audit trails
   - Log aggregation and analysis

## Next Scheduled Audit

The next comprehensive security audit is scheduled for June 1, 2025.

## Security Guidelines for Developers

Developers should follow these security best practices:

1. Follow the secure coding guidelines in `/docs/security/secure_coding.md`
2. Use the security-approved libraries listed in `/docs/security/approved_dependencies.md`
3. Run the security linting tools before submitting code
4. Attend the monthly security awareness training
5. Report potential security issues to the security team
