# üöÄ START HERE: Project Assessment System ‚Äì Master Audit Command Brief

Welcome to the **Project Assessment System**. This folder contains the official audit and remediation framework for validating and hardening software systems across all phases of development ‚Äî from internal QA to investor-ready compliance.

---

## üéØ PURPOSE

This system exists to:
- Identify and eliminate critical technical debt
- Enforce world-class engineering standards
- Simulate enterprise and regulatory compliance audits
- Prepare software for MVP launch, public beta, or acquisition
- Hold coding agents and dev teams accountable to structured, auditable QA

---

## üìÇ WHAT'S IN THIS FOLDER

You will find four full audit layers, each with:
- A formal audit brief
- A matching remediation strategy
- A coder agent instruction sheet (for Level 1/2)
- Versioned changelogs and task logs

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Audit_Level_1.md` | Internal QA + technical hygiene audit |
| `Audit_Level_1_Strategy.md` | Fix plan for foundational issues |
| `Audit_Level_2.md` | Enterprise-grade stability, CI/CD, AI, and security audit |
| `Audit_Level_2_Strategy.md` | Fix plan for high-severity deployment blockers |
| `Audit_Level_3.md` | External-facing: legal, ethical, AI governance, WCAG, investor-readiness |
| `Audit_Level_3_Strategy.md` | Fix plan for compliance and certification alignment |
| `Audit_Level_4.md` | Final integrated QA sweep - launch readiness verification |
| `Coder_Agent_Remediation_Instructions.md` | Mandatory execution protocol for remediation |
| `process/AUDIT_PROCESS_GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive guide for conducting multi-level audits |

---

## üîç HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM

1. **Read each audit level in order.**
   - Do NOT skip to Level 2 or 3 until Level 1 remediation is complete and verified.
   - Only proceed to Level 4 (Launch Readiness) after successful completion of Levels 1-3.

2. **Run the audit as described.**
   - Score the system with brutal honesty.
   - Save all results and logs in the project management directory.

3. **Follow the matching strategy document.**
   - Each remediation plan is category-based and sequenced.
   - Implement them step-by-step without deviation.

4. **Coders follow instruction protocols.**
   - No side quests. No premature enhancements.
   - Document every change in `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION.md`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è GOAL

The end result is a system that:
- Passes all 4 audits with a score of **90/100 or higher**
- Is fully WCAG 2.2, GDPR, and AI-compliant
- Can be safely launched to the public or presented to investors
- Has clear rollback, test, versioning, and governance documentation
- Successfully completes the final launch readiness verification

This is your operational blueprint. Every serious software product should be able to pass these layers before entering production or funding rounds.

Do not proceed until you've read and understood every file in this folder.
