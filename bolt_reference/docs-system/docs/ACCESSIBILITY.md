# MAIK-AI-CODING-APP - Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

MAIK-AI-CODING-APP is committed to providing an accessible development environment for all users, including those with disabilities. Our accessibility standards ensure that all developers, regardless of ability, can utilize the full power of our AI-assisted coding platform.

## Standards & Compliance

- **Target WCAG Level**: WCAG 2.1 AA (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Specific Requirements**: Support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast mode
- **Legal Considerations**: Compliance with ADA requirements and international accessibility standards

## Key Principles

1. **Perceivable**
   - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
   
2. **Operable**
   - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
   
3. **Understandable**
   - Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
   
4. **Robust**
   - Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML

- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Use semantic elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) for groups of related items
- Use tables for tabular data with proper headings

```html
<!-- Good Example -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<main>
  <h1>Page Title</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Content goes here.</p>
  </section>
</main>
