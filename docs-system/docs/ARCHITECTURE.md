# MAIK-AI-CODING-APP - Architecture

## System Overview

MAIK-AI-CODING-APP employs a modular monolith architecture with clean architecture principles, allowing for maintainable code, testability, and future scalability. The system is organized into distinct functional domains with clear boundaries and interfaces, supported by a centralized error handling and monitoring system.

## Architectural Principles

- Separation of Concerns: Each component has a single responsibility and is organized into appropriate layers
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions
- Interface Segregation: Components expose only what's needed by their consumers through well-defined interfaces
- Dependency Injection: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
