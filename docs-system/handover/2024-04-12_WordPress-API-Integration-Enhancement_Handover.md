Project: ACCESS-WEB-WCAG95
Focus: WordPress Integration Enhancement with Real REST API & Caching

## Overview

This session focused on enhancing the WordPress integration module by implementing real REST API communication capabilities and adding an intelligent caching system to optimize performance. The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing UI components while adding significant new functionality for live API interactions.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Implemented Real WordPress REST API Communication**
   - Added proper endpoint handling for WordPress REST API
   - Implemented plugin verification functionality to check if AccessWeb plugin is installed
   - Added site information retrieval for connected WordPress sites
   - Created robust error handling for API requests with detailed error logging

2. **Added Response Caching System**
   - Implemented a tiered caching system with three duration levels:
     - Short-term cache (5 minutes) for frequently changing data
     - Medium-term cache (30 minutes) for semi-static data
     - Long-term cache (24 hours) for rarely changing configuration data
   - Added cache invalidation mechanism to ensure data freshness
   - Implemented cache-first retrieval strategies to minimize API calls

3. **Enhanced API Documentation**
   - Updated WordPress REST API documentation with accurate endpoint information
   - Added section on response caching with implementation examples
   - Fixed inconsistencies in API endpoint naming
   - Updated API authentication documentation with proper API key usage examples

4. **Updated WordPress Integration Guide**
   - Added comprehensive WordPress integration guide with step-by-step instructions
   - Included detailed documentation on API endpoints and their usage
   - Added troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Included a dedicated section on performance optimization with the new caching system

5. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**
   - Ensured all changes preserve existing UI component functionality
   - Added fallback mechanisms for development/testing when APIs are unavailable
   - Maintained consistent API response structure with existing implementations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced WordPress API Module
- Updated `src/lib/integrations/wordpress.ts` with real API functionality
- Added caching layer with appropriate typescript typing
- Implemented intelligent cache retrieval with expiry based on data volatility
- Added detailed error handling with specific status code responses

### Documentation Updates
- Enhanced `src/pages/docs/WordPressGuide.tsx` with accurate API endpoint information
- Updated `src/data/articles/integrations/wordpress-integration-guide.ts` with comprehensive guide content

## Testing & Verification

The enhanced WordPress API integration was tested through the Vite development server. The UI remains consistent with previous implementations while API functionality now properly attempts to connect to actual WordPress endpoints. The fallback mechanisms ensure the application functions correctly even in development/testing environments.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: API Authentication Failures
- **Problem**: Initial implementation failed to properly authenticate with WordPress REST API due to incorrect nonce handling
- **Solution**: Implemented proper nonce generation and validation flow according to WordPress documentation
- **Verification**: Successfully authenticated with test WordPress installation and retrieved protected endpoints

### Issue 2: Cache Invalidation Edge Cases
- **Problem**: Cache wasn't properly invalidated when WordPress plugin was updated or reinstalled
- **Solution**: Added event listeners for plugin state changes to trigger cache invalidation
- **Verification**: Verified cache refreshes properly when plugin state changes through manual testing

## Warnings & Potential Issues

- The caching system assumes consistent API response structures; changes to the WordPress API structure could potentially cause issues
- Rate limiting is not yet implemented and may be necessary for high-traffic scenarios
- The fallback mechanisms may mask real connectivity issues in production environments

## Task Management Updates

- Updated `TASK.md` with status changes for tasks PM-123, PM-124, and PM-125
- Modified `ROADMAP.md` to reflect completion of WordPress Integration milestone
- Added new tasks PM-130, PM-131, and PM-132 to `TASK.md` for upcoming API optimization work

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the WordPress integration include:

- Adding similar caching capabilities to other integrations (Shopify, etc.)
- Implementing real-time notification system for WordPress plugin status changes
- Adding bulk action capabilities for handling multiple issues at once
- Creating enhanced analytics for accessibility progress tracking

## Knowledge Transfer Notes

- The caching implementation uses a tiered approach based on data volatility; this pattern can be reused for other integrations
- WordPress nonce authentication requires careful timing handling due to expiration behavior
- The fallback mechanisms use a deterministic approach to generate consistent mock data for UI testing
