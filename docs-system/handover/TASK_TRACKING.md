## Resource Requirements

- **Developer Skills Needed:**
  - TypeScript expertise
  - AI/ML integration experience
  - Testing experience with Jest or similar
  - Performance monitoring experience
  - Database integration skills

- **Infrastructure Needed:**
  - Vector database for production memory storage
  - Monitoring system integration (Grafana or similar)
  - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Conclusion

The core components of the MAIK-AI-CODING-APP have been successfully implemented, providing a solid foundation for the system. The next phase should focus on tool integration, performance monitoring, and AI governance while addressing key technical debt items.

The highest priority tasks are implementing the tool registry system and associated components, as these are critical for the system's functionality as a coding assistant. Testing should also be prioritized to ensure stability as the system grows in complexity.
