# AI Agent Handover Documentation

This directory contains AI agent handover documents that provide comprehensive information about development sessions, task completions, issues, and knowledge transfer between AI agents.

## Purpose

AI agent handover documentation serves several critical purposes:

1. **Documentation Continuity**: Ensures that knowledge and progress are maintained when transitioning between AI agent sessions
2. **Issue Tracking**: Provides a record of encountered problems and their resolutions
3. **Implementation Details**: Documents specific technical decisions and implementations
4. **Task Management**: Updates project progress tracking and task status
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitates smooth transitions between different AI agents working on the project

## Handover Document Requirements

Each handover document must include:

### 1. Basic Information
- Date and time of handover
- AI agent identifier
- Project name and focus area
- Brief overview of the session

### 2. Task Details
- Comprehensive list of completed tasks categorized by area
- Implementation details with file paths and code references
- Testing and verification methods used
- Issues encountered and their resolutions

### 3. Task Management Updates
- Changes to task statuses
- Updates to project timelines or milestones
- New tasks created or identified
- Current blocking issues or dependencies

### 4. Knowledge Transfer
- Technical context necessary for the next agent
- Warnings about potential issues or edge cases
- Recommended next steps
- References to relevant documentation, research, or external resources

## Handover Process

When completing a development session, AI agents must:

1. Create a new handover document using the `AGENT_HANDOVER.md` template
2. Complete all sections with detailed, specific information
3. Place the document in this directory with a filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_SessionFocus_Handover.md`
4. Update all relevant task management documents with current status
5. Reference the handover document in any related issue tracking systems

## Handover Best Practices

- Be specific and detailed, avoiding vague statements
- Include file paths, function names, and line numbers when describing changes
- Document not just what was done, but why decisions were made
- Highlight any deviations from original specifications and their justification
- Include error messages, logs, or other diagnostic information for unresolved issues
- Provide clear, actionable next steps for the subsequent agent
- Reference all relevant documentation that was consulted or updated
