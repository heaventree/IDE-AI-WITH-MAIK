# AI Agent Roles and Permissions Matrix

## Overview

This document defines the roles and permissions for AI agents working with the Documentation System. It establishes a clear ownership model for different parts of the codebase to prevent conflicts and ensure quality when multiple agents are working simultaneously.

## Role Definitions

### 1. Architecture Agent

**Responsibility**: Manages core architecture components and ensures adherence to clean architecture principles.

**Ownership Areas**:
- Core domain models and interfaces
- Application service interfaces
- Architecture documentation
- System-wide patterns and standards

### 2. Documentation Agent

**Responsibility**: Creates, maintains, and updates documentation content.

**Ownership Areas**:
- Templates and snippets
- User guides and manuals
- API documentation
- Example code and usage examples

### 3. Infrastructure Agent

**Responsibility**: Handles infrastructure implementation and technical configuration.

**Ownership Areas**:
- Database adapters and repositories
- External service integrations
- Event handling infrastructure
- Logging and monitoring

### 4. Interface Agent

**Responsibility**: Manages user and API interfaces.

**Ownership Areas**:
- API controllers and routes
- UI components and views
- Request/response handling
- Data presentation and formatting

### 5. Validation Agent

**Responsibility**: Ensures documentation quality and compliance with standards.

**Ownership Areas**:
- Validation tools and processes
- Quality assurance checks
- Documentation audits
- Compliance verification

## Permissions Matrix

| Directory/File | Architect Agent | Documentation Agent | Infrastructure Agent | Interface Agent | Validation Agent |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `/architecture/core/domain/` | Owner | Read | Read | Read | Read |
| `/architecture/application/` | Owner | Read | Contribute | Contribute | Read |
| `/architecture/infrastructure/` | Contribute | Read | Owner | Read | Read |
| `/architecture/interfaces/` | Contribute | Contribute | Read | Owner | Read |
| `/templates/` | Contribute | Owner | Read | Read | Contribute |
| `/snippets/` | Contribute | Owner | Read | Read | Contribute |
| `/handover/` | Contribute | Owner | Contribute | Contribute | Contribute |
| `/audits/` | Read | Contribute | Read | Read | Owner |
| `/validation/` | Read | Contribute | Read | Read | Owner |
| `/agent/` | Owner | Contribute | Contribute | Contribute | Contribute |
| `/docs/` | Contribute | Owner | Contribute | Contribute | Contribute |
| `/tools/` | Contribute | Contribute | Owner | Contribute | Contribute |

**Legend**:
- **Owner**: Primary responsibility and final decision authority
- **Contribute**: Can make changes but should consult with the owner
- **Read**: Reference access only, should propose changes to owner or contributors

## Collaboration Guidelines

When multiple agents are working on the Documentation System:

1. **Check Ownership**: Before modifying a file, check the permissions matrix to determine the appropriate role.

2. **Communicate Changes**: When making changes in a directory you don't own, document your rationale and notify the owner agent.

3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If multiple agents need to modify the same files, follow these steps:
   - The owner agent has final decision authority
   - Agents should propose changes with clear justification
   - Compromise solutions should be sought when possible

4. **Respect Boundaries**: Don't modify files outside your ownership or contribution areas without explicit authorization.

## Handover Protocol

When transitioning work between agents:

1. Document current state of work clearly
2. Flag any incomplete tasks or known issues
3. Provide context for any recent decisions
4. Reference this roles document to clarify ownership

## Escalation Path

For situations where role boundaries are unclear or conflicting changes are required:

1. Consult this roles document
2. If unresolved, escalate to the Architecture Agent
3. If still unresolved, document the conflict and request human intervention

*This roles and permissions matrix should evolve as the system grows. Updates require consensus from all agent roles or authorization from human developers.*
