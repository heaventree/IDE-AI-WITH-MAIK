# AI Agent Initialization Guide

## Overview

This document serves as the entry point for AI agents working with the Documentation System. It provides essential information about the system architecture, guidelines for populating templates, and instructions for maintaining document quality.

## System Purpose

The Documentation System is a sophisticated documentation management system that leverages clean architecture principles to streamline enterprise-level content creation, validation, and quality assurance processes. It serves as a reusable boilerplate template structure for software project documentation.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows clean architecture principles with domain-driven design:

1. **Core Domain Layer**
   - Contains business entities, value objects, and domain logic
   - Location: `/architecture/core/domain/`

2. **Application Layer**
   - Contains application services, use cases, and DTOs
   - Location: `/architecture/application/`

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Contains implementations of repositories, services, and external integrations
   - Location: `/architecture/infrastructure/`

4. **Interfaces Layer**
   - Contains API routes, controllers, and UI components
   - Location: `/architecture/interfaces/`

## Placeholder Syntax Standard

When working with the Documentation System, use the following placeholder syntax to indicate sections that need to be populated:

```
// [AGENT_FILL: brief description of what needs to be filled]
```

For HTML or Markdown files, use:

```html
<!-- AGENT_PLACEHOLDER: brief description of what needs to be filled -->
```

Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Document Repository Interface
 */
class DocumentRepository {
  // [AGENT_FILL: implement methods for document persistence]
  
  async findById(id) {
    // [AGENT_FILL: implement findById method]
  }
}
```

## Population Order

When populating the Documentation System, follow this order:

1. **Core Domain Models**
   - Start with fundamental domain models, entities, and value objects
   - Ensure they encapsulate business rules and invariants

2. **Domain Services**
   - Implement services that operate on multiple domain entities
   - Focus on business logic that doesn't naturally fit in entities

3. **Application Services**
   - Implement use cases that orchestrate domain objects
   - Create DTOs for input and output

4. **Infrastructure Components**
   - Implement repositories, event handlers, and external service adapters
   - Ensure they adhere to interfaces defined in the domain layer

5. **API and UI Components**
   - Implement API routes, controllers, and UI components
   - Focus on presentation logic and user interactions

## Documentation Standards

When creating or modifying documentation:

1. **Use Clear Language**
   - Write in clear, concise language
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary and properly explained

2. **Include Examples**
   - Provide examples for complex concepts
   - Include code snippets where appropriate

3. **Maintain Structure**
   - Follow the established document structure
   - Use appropriate headings and formatting

4. **Cross-Reference**
   - Link related documents
   - Ensure navigation paths are clear

## Template Usage

Templates are located in the `/templates/` directory. When using templates:

1. Remove all placeholder markers after filling in content
2. Ensure all sections are populated with relevant content
3. Customize the template to fit the specific context
4. Keep the structure consistent with other documents

## Quality Assurance

Before finalizing any document:

1. Check for completeness (all placeholders filled)
2. Verify technical accuracy
3. Ensure consistency with related documents
4. Remove any duplicate information
5. Run automated validation if available

## Next Steps

After initializing, refer to these resources:

1. [README.md](/README.md) - Main project overview
2. [Directory Structure](/docs-system/architecture/README.md) - System architecture details
3. [Templates Guide](/templates/README.md) - How to use document templates

This initialization guide is designed to help AI agents understand their role and responsibilities when working with the Documentation System. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, high-quality documentation across the project.
