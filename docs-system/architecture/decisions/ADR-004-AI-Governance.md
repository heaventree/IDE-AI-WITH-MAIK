# ADR-004: AI Governance Framework Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As Bolt DIY integrates advanced AI capabilities, we need to address several concerns related to AI governance:

1. Lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes
2. Potential for bias in AI-generated content and recommendations
3. No audit trail for AI interactions
4. Limited control over AI usage in different contexts
5. Need for responsible AI development and deployment

These issues pose risks related to accountability, fairness, and compliance with emerging AI regulations.

## Decision

We will implement an AI Governance framework with the following components:

1. Model registration and metadata tracking
2. Decision logging for all AI interactions
3. Bias detection and reporting mechanisms
4. Usage monitoring and limitations enforcement
5. Explanation generation for AI decisions
6. Audit trail for governance actions

The AI Governance module will be integrated with the core system architecture using dependency injection.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enhanced transparency in AI operations
- Reduced risk of bias through detection and mitigation
- Improved compliance with emerging AI regulations
- Better debugging and analysis of AI behavior
- Framework for responsible AI development

### Negative

- Additional overhead for logging and monitoring
- Potential impact on performance from governance checks
- Increased complexity in the system architecture
- Need for ongoing maintenance of governance rules

## Implementation Notes

The AI Governance framework will consist of:

1. **Governance Module**: Central component that manages all governance aspects
2. **Model Registry**: Database of AI models with capabilities and limitations
3. **Decision Logger**: Records all AI decisions with metadata
4. **Bias Detector**: Analyzes output for potential bias using rules and models
5. **Explainability Service**: Generates explanations for complex AI decisions

The module will integrate with the core Agent through dependency injection.

## Example

```typescript
export class AIGovernance {
  constructor(
    private modelRegistry: Map<string, ModelMetadata>,
    private decisionStore: IDecisionStore,
    private biasDetector: IBiasDetector,
    private logger: ILogger
  ) {}

  registerModel(modelId: string, metadata: ModelMetadata): void {
    this.modelRegistry.set(modelId, metadata);
    this.logger.info(`Model registered: ${modelId}`, { metadata });
  }

  logDecision(modelId: string, decision: Decision): string {
    // Validate model exists
    if (!this.modelRegistry.has(modelId)) {
      throw new Error(`Model ${modelId} not registered`);
    }

    // Generate decision ID
    const decisionId = generateUniqueId();
    
    // Store decision with metadata
    this.decisionStore.storeDecision(decisionId, {
      ...decision,
      modelId,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      modelMetadata: this.modelRegistry.get(modelId)
    });
    
    return decisionId;
  }

  analyzeTextForBias(text: string): BiasAnalysisResult {
    return this.biasDetector.analyze(text);
  }

  generateExplanation(modelId: string, decision: Decision): Explanation {
    // Generate human-readable explanation for the decision
    const model = this.modelRegistry.get(modelId);
    
    return {
      modelInfo: {
        name: model?.name || modelId,
        capabilities: model?.capabilities || [],
        limitations: model?.limitations || []
      },
      approach: `The ${model?.name || "AI"} analyzed the input and generated a response based on its training data.`,
      confidence: decision.confidence || "unknown"
    };
  }
}
```
