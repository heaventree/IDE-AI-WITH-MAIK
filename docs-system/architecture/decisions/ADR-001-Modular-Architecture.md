# ADR-001: Modular Architecture with Dependency Injection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Bolt DIY system is currently implemented as a monolithic application with tightly coupled components. This architecture makes it difficult to maintain, test, and extend the system. Key issues include:

1. Tight coupling between components leads to cascading changes when one part is modified
2. Limited testability due to lack of isolation
3. Difficult to scale or replace individual components
4. Challenging to understand the system as a whole

## Decision

We will refactor the system to use a modular architecture with dependency injection. This includes:

1. Defining clear interfaces for each major component (StateManager, MemoryManager, PromptManager, ToolExecutor)
2. Implementing these interfaces in concrete classes that can be injected
3. Using the tsyringe library for dependency injection
4. Centralizing the dependency registration in a single module

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved testability through the ability to mock dependencies
- Enhanced maintainability with clearer separation of concerns
- Better scalability as components can be replaced or enhanced independently
- Easier onboarding for new developers with well-defined component boundaries

### Negative

- Initial refactoring effort is substantial
- Potential for slight performance overhead from dependency injection
- Increased complexity in the system architecture

## Implementation Notes

The implementation will follow the dependency inversion principle, where high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. The key components will be:

1. **Interface Definition**: Define interfaces for each component in `interfaces/index.ts`
2. **Implementation Classes**: Create concrete implementations of each interface
3. **Dependency Container**: Configure tsyringe container in `di-container.ts`
4. **Agent Class**: Refactor the core Agent class to accept dependencies via constructor injection

## Example

```typescript
// Interface Definition
export interface IMemoryManager {
  getContext(sessionId: string, query: string): Promise<MemoryContext>;
  storeInteraction(sessionId: string, interaction: Interaction): Promise<void>;
}

// Implementation Class
@injectable()
export class AdvancedMemoryManager implements IMemoryManager {
  constructor(
    @inject("VectorStore") private vectorStore: IVectorStore,
    @inject("Logger") private logger: ILogger
  ) {}
  
  async getContext(sessionId: string, query: string): Promise<MemoryContext> {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  async storeInteraction(sessionId: string, interaction: Interaction): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation details
  }
}

// Dependency Registration
container.register<IMemoryManager>("IMemoryManager", {
  useClass: AdvancedMemoryManager
});

// Usage in Agent
@injectable()
export class Agent {
  constructor(
    @inject("IMemoryManager") private memoryManager: IMemoryManager,
    @inject("IPromptManager") private promptManager: IPromptManager,
    // Other dependencies
  ) {}
  
  async handleRequest(userInput: string, sessionId: string): Promise<string> {
    // Use injected dependencies
    const context = await this.memoryManager.getContext(sessionId, userInput);
    // ...
  }
}
```
