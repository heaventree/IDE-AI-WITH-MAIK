# ADR 001: Adoption of Clean Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Documentation System requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can support enterprise requirements. The Level 3 Audit identified several architectural issues:

1. Components exist in isolation without comprehensive integration
2. Dependency injection patterns are inconsistently applied
3. Service boundaries are poorly defined with potential for circular dependencies
4. No clear separation of concerns across layers

We need an architectural approach that provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independence from frameworks and external dependencies
- Testability at all levels
- The ability to evolve different parts of the system independently

## Decision

We will adopt Clean Architecture principles as defined by Robert C. Martin, organizing the system into concentric layers:

1. **Core Domain Layer** (innermost)
   - Contains enterprise business rules, entities, and value objects
   - Has no dependencies on outer layers or external frameworks
   - Pure business logic with domain-specific rules

2. **Application Layer**
   - Contains application-specific business rules (use cases)
   - Depends only on the domain layer
   - Orchestrates the flow of data between outer and inner layers
   - Implements use cases using domain entities

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Contains adapters for database, external services, etc.
   - Implements interfaces defined in inner layers
   - Depends on application and domain layers

4. **Interfaces Layer** (outermost)
   - Contains UI components, API controllers, etc.
   - Transforms external requests into internal format
   - Depends on application layer for use cases
   - Framework-specific code isolated here

### Key Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies always point inward. Inner layers know nothing about outer layers.
2. **Entities**: Business objects encapsulating critical business rules
3. **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules
4. **Interface Adapters**: Conversion between formats suitable for entities/use cases and external systems
5. **Frameworks and Drivers**: Outermost layer containing frameworks and tools

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Testability**: Core business logic can be tested independently of UI, database, and external services
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to external concerns (UI, database) don't affect business logic
3. **Flexibility**: The system can adapt to changing requirements and technologies
4. **Independence**: Development work can proceed independently on different layers
5. **Focus on Domain**: Architecture emphasizes business domain over technical concerns

### Negative

1. **Indirection**: More layers and interfaces lead to more indirection and potentially more code
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand architectural boundaries and principles
3. **Initial Velocity**: May slow initial development as infrastructure is established
4. **Complexity**: Can seem over-engineered for simple use cases

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure

│   ├── application/    # Application layer
│   ├── infrastructure/ # Infrastructure layer
│   └── interfaces/     # Interfaces layer
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**Core Domain Layer**:
- Entities and value objects
- Domain services
- Domain events
- Domain exceptions
- Repository interfaces

**Application Layer**:
- Use cases / application services
- Command and query handlers
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Application events
- External service interfaces

**Infrastructure Layer**:
- Repository implementations
- Database access
- External service integrations
- Messaging infrastructure
- Caching implementations
- Logging implementations

**Interfaces Layer**:
- Controllers (API, Web)
- View models
- API models
- Validators
- Middleware

### Dependency Injection

We will use constructor injection for all dependencies, making them explicit:

```javascript
class DocumentService {
  constructor(documentRepository, eventPublisher) {
    this.documentRepository = documentRepository;
    this.eventPublisher = eventPublisher;
  }
  
  // Methods that use injected dependencies
}
```

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

For cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and error handling, we will:
1. Define interfaces in the appropriate inner layer
2. Implement these interfaces in the infrastructure layer
3. Inject these implementations via dependency injection

## Compliance

This architectural approach directly addresses the Level 3 Audit findings by:
1. Providing clear component integration through defined layer interfaces
2. Enforcing consistent dependency injection patterns
3. Defining explicit service boundaries
4. Establishing clear separation of concerns across layers
