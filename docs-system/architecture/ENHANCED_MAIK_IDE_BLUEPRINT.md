# Enhanced MAIK AI Coding IDE Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for an enhanced Agentic AI coding IDE based on the Bolt DIY system, addressing key limitations while building upon its strengths. The enhanced system, named "MAIK IDE", will provide a more robust, extensible, and user-friendly experience for AI-assisted code development.

## Current Bolt DIY Assessment

### Strengths
