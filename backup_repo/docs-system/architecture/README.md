# Documentation System Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural foundation for the Documentation System, following Clean Architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design approaches. This architecture is designed to create a scalable, maintainable, and testable system that can evolve over time while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward, with inner layers having no knowledge of outer layers
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different aspects of the system
3. **Inversion of Control**: Dependencies are provided to components rather than created by them
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
5. **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are declared explicitly, not hidden

## Directory Structure

The architecture is organized into the following layers:

- **Core**: Contains the domain model, business rules, and domain services
  - Pure business logic with no dependencies on external frameworks or libraries
  - Entities, value objects, domain events, and domain services
  - Domain-specific exceptions and interfaces

- **Application**: Contains application-specific business rules and use cases
  - Orchestrates the flow of data and implements use cases
  - Dependencies only on the core domain layer
  - Application services, commands, queries, and DTOs
  - Event handlers and application-level interfaces

- **Infrastructure**: Contains implementations of interfaces defined in inner layers
  - Database access, external service integrations, and framework-specific code
  - Implementations of repositories, notification services, etc.
  - Third-party integrations and technical concerns

- **Interfaces**: Contains delivery mechanisms and UI components
  - API controllers, web controllers, and UI components
  - Request/response models, validators, and presenters
  - Framework-specific adapters and configuration

## Key Concepts

### Domain-Driven Design

The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design principles:

- **Bounded Contexts**: Explicit boundaries around domain models
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology throughout the codebase
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects treated as a unit
- **Entities**: Objects with a unique identity and lifecycle
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity
- **Domain Events**: Notifications of significant occurrences in the domain
- **Repositories**: Abstractions for persistence operations
- **Domain Services**: Operations that don't belong to a specific entity

### Clean Architecture

The system follows Clean Architecture patterns:

- **Independence from Frameworks**: The core business logic doesn't depend on external frameworks
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Independence from UI**: The UI can change without affecting the business logic
- **Independence from Database**: The database can be changed without affecting the business logic
- **Independence from External Agencies**: Business rules don't depend on external services

## Flow of Control

1. External requests come in through the interfaces layer
2. The interfaces layer maps requests to application layer commands/queries
3. The application layer orchestrates the use case using domain objects
4. The domain layer executes business logic
5. The application layer uses infrastructure services through abstractions
6. The interfaces layer returns appropriate responses

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Logging**: Consistent logging throughout the application
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Security enforced at appropriate boundaries
- **Validation**: Input validation at system boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management and reporting
- **Monitoring**: Performance and health monitoring
- **Resilience**: Retry policies, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies

## Architectural Decision Records

The `docs/adrs` directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions, the context in which they were made, and their consequences.

## Diagrams

The `docs/diagrams` directory contains architectural diagrams:

- Component diagrams showing system structure
- Sequence diagrams showing key flows
- Domain model diagrams
- Context maps showing bounded contexts

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Use constructor injection for dependencies
2. **Immutable Objects**: Prefer immutable objects where possible
3. **Tell, Don't Ask**: Tell objects what to do rather than asking for their state
4. **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs at boundaries and fail immediately on invalid input
5. **Exception Handling**: Use domain-specific exceptions in the domain layer
6. **Testing**: Write tests at all levels, prioritizing domain and application logic
