# Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and best practices for creating and maintaining documentation in the Documentation System. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, quality, and usefulness of all documentation.

## General Principles

### 1. Audience-Oriented

Always consider your audience:
- Define the target audience at the beginning of each document
- Adjust technical depth based on audience expertise
- Use appropriate language and terminology
- Avoid jargon unless necessary and well-explained

### 2. Clear and Concise

- Use simple, direct language
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short
- Focus on essential information
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Avoid redundancy and repetition

### 3. Well-Structured

- Use consistent and logical headings
- Follow the established template structure
- Include a clear introduction and conclusion
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Group related information together

### 4. Complete and Accurate

- Ensure technical accuracy of all content
- Cover all necessary aspects of the topic
- Provide context and background information
- Include relevant examples and code snippets
- Cite sources and references when appropriate

### 5. Maintainable

- Follow version control best practices
- Use standardized placeholder syntax for incomplete sections
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Include "Last Updated" dates on all documents

## Formatting Standards

### Markdown Usage

- Use proper Markdown syntax for all documentation
- Follow heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)
- Use code blocks with language specification for code snippets
- Use tables for structured data
- Use bold and italic text sparingly and consistently

### Code Examples

- Include complete, runnable examples when possible
- Use consistent code formatting and style
- Include comments in code examples
- Highlight important parts of the code
- Ensure code examples are accurate and tested

### Images and Diagrams

- Use clear, readable diagrams
- Include alt text for all images
- Keep file sizes reasonable
- Use SVG format for diagrams when possible
- Ensure diagrams match the current architecture

## File Organization

- Use the established directory structure
- Follow consistent file naming conventions
- Group related documentation together
- Use README.md files to provide context for directories
- Cross-reference related documentation

## Template Usage

- Start with the appropriate template for the document type
- Complete all sections or explicitly note why a section is omitted
- Remove all placeholder markers in the final document
- Customize templates as needed for specific contexts
- Ensure documentation follows the established structure

## Review Process

Before finalizing any documentation:

1. **Self-Review**: Check for completeness, accuracy, and clarity
2. **Technical Review**: Have a subject matter expert verify technical accuracy
3. **Editorial Review**: Check for language, grammar, and style consistency
4. **User Testing**: When possible, have representative users test the documentation

## Documentation Types

### Technical Documentation

- Focus on technical accuracy and completeness
- Include configuration details and parameters
- Provide troubleshooting information
- Include code examples and API references
- Document edge cases and limitations

### User Documentation

- Focus on usability and clarity
- Use task-based organization
- Include screenshots and visual aids
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Address common questions and issues

### Architecture Documentation

- Focus on system design and components
- Include diagrams and visual representations
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Explain relationships between components
- Cover both current state and planned evolution

## Version Control

- Document which version of software the documentation applies to
- Maintain documentation alongside code in version control
- Use branches for major documentation revisions
- Follow the established commit message format
- Include documentation updates in release notes

## Quality Checklist
