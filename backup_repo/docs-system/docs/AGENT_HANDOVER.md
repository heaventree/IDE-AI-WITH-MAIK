# MAIK-AI-CODING-APP - AI Agent Handover Document
Date: April 17, 2025
AI Agent: Developer Team
Project: MAIK-AI-CODING-APP
Focus: Core Architecture Implementation and Documentation

## Overview

The MAIK-AI-CODING-APP project has reached a significant milestone with the completion of the core documentation and initial architecture implementation. The focus has been on establishing a solid foundation for the remediation effort, with particular attention to dependency injection, error handling, and state management.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core Documentation**
   - Completed project overview documentation
   - Finalized architecture documentation including component diagrams
   - Created comprehensive coding standards guide
   - Documented security protocols and best practices

2. **System Architecture**
   - Implemented ErrorHandler with Sentry integration
   - Created StateManager for application state persistence
   - Set up dependency injection container
   - Implemented basic interfaces for core components

3. **Migration Preparation**
   - Identified all legacy components requiring migration
   - Created migration plan with priority sequence
   - Set up testing infrastructure for migration validation
   - Prepared template codebase for new components

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling System
- Created centralized ErrorHandler with standardized error response format
- Integrated Sentry for error monitoring and tracking
- Implemented user-friendly error messages with technical details abstraction

### State Management
- Implemented in-memory state persistence with session identification
- Created typed interfaces for state operations
- Added state versioning for conflict resolution

## Testing & Verification

Basic unit tests have been implemented for the ErrorHandler and StateManager components. Current test coverage is approximately 65%, with the goal of reaching 80% as development continues. All tests are passing in the current build.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Sentry Integration Type Compatibility
- **Problem**: Type mismatch between Sentry SDK and our TypeScript interfaces
- **Solution**: Created adapter layer to reconcile type differences
- **Verification**: All integration tests passing with adapter in place

### Issue 2: Memory Optimization in State Manager
- **Problem**: Potential memory leaks from unbounded session storage
- **Solution**: Implemented session timeout and garbage collection
- **Verification**: Memory profiling shows stable memory usage pattern

## Warnings & Potential Issues

- Sentry integration still has some type compatibility warnings that should be addressed in future updates
- The current state management solution is suitable for development but will need optimization for production
- Token usage efficiency improvements are still pending final implementation

## Task Management Updates

- Updated project task tracking board with status changes for tasks MAIK-101 through MAIK-115
- Modified milestone tracking sheet to reflect completion of milestone Documentation and Core Architecture
- Added new tasks MAIK-123, MAIK-124, MAIK-125 to sprint planning document for upcoming work

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the project include:

- Implement Memory Manager with vector search capabilities
- Develop Tool Executor for external tool integration
- Complete Prompt Manager with template support
- Begin migration of legacy UI components to new architecture

## Knowledge Transfer Notes

- All architecture decisions are documented in ARCHITECTURE.md with rationales
- Core interfaces are commented with JSDoc to explain design intent
- Example implementations are provided for each interface in the docs/examples directory
