# Risk Register

## Overview

This Risk Register serves as the central repository for identifying, assessing, tracking, and mitigating risks for {{PROJECT_NAME}}. It is a living document that should be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| | **Low Impact (1)** | **Medium Impact (2)** | **High Impact (3)** | **Critical Impact (4)** |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **High Probability (4)** | Moderate (4) | High (8) | Critical (12) | Critical (16) |
| **Medium Probability (3)** | Low (3) | Moderate (6) | High (9) | Critical (12) |
| **Low Probability (2)** | Low (2) | Moderate (4) | Moderate (6) | High (8) |
| **Very Low Probability (1)** | Very Low (1) | Low (2) | Low (3) | Moderate (4) |

**Risk Severity Scale:**
- **Very Low (1-2)**: Monitor only, no active mitigation required
- **Low (3-4)**: Basic mitigation, periodic monitoring
- **Moderate (5-6)**: Active mitigation required, regular monitoring
- **High (7-9)**: Immediate attention needed, detailed mitigation plan, frequent monitoring
- **Critical (10-16)**: Immediate escalation to project leadership, comprehensive mitigation strategy, constant monitoring

## Risk Categories

1. **Technical Risks**: Related to technology, implementation, integration, and performance
2. **Schedule Risks**: Impacts to project timeline, deliverable dates, and dependencies
3. **Resource Risks**: Issues related to staffing, expertise, availability, and allocation
4. **Budget Risks**: Financial impacts, cost overruns, and funding concerns
5. **Scope Risks**: Changes or ambiguities in project scope and requirements
6. **Vendor/External Risks**: Risks related to third-party providers, contractors, and external dependencies
7. **Operational Risks**: Risks to business operations, transitions, and implementations
8. **Security Risks**: Data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity concerns
9. **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory, legal, and policy compliance issues

## Risk Status Tracking

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Identified | Risk has been identified but not yet analyzed fully |
| Analyzed | Risk has been assessed and rated for probability and impact |
| Mitigating | Risk mitigation strategies are actively being implemented |
| Monitoring | Risk is being regularly monitored but no active mitigation |
| Escalated | Risk has been escalated to higher management for attention |
| Occurred | Risk event has happened, contingency plan is being executed |
| Closed | Risk is no longer relevant or has been completely mitigated |

## Risk Identification Process

### Sources for Risk Identification

1. Project team brainstorming sessions
2. Expert interviews and consultations
3. Historical data from similar projects
4. Project documentation reviews
5. Stakeholder consultations
6. Technical assessments and audits
7. Vendor performance analysis
8. Market and industry analysis

## Risk Response Planning

### Risk Response Strategies

1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
2. **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability and/or impact of the risk
3. **Transfer**: Shift the burden of the risk to a third party
4. **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk but take no proactive action
5. **Exploit**: For positive risks (opportunities), actions to ensure the opportunity is realized
6. **Share**: For positive risks, allocate ownership to a third party best able to capture the opportunity
7. **Enhance**: For positive risks, increase the probability and/or impact of the opportunity

| 2 | Low | 10-30% chance of occurrence |
| 3 | Medium | 30-60% chance of occurrence |

#### Impact Scoring

| Score | Description | Cost Impact | Schedule Impact | Scope Impact | Quality Impact |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Low | < 5% budget increase | < 5% schedule slip | Minor areas affected | Only demanding applications affected |
| 2 | Medium | 5-10% budget increase | 5-10% schedule slip | Major areas affected | Quality reduction requires sponsor approval |
| 3 | High | 10-20% budget increase | 10-20% schedule slip | Scope reduction unacceptable to sponsor | Quality reduction unacceptable to sponsor |
| 4 | Critical | > 20% budget increase | > 20% schedule slip | Project end item effectively useless | Project end item effectively useless |
