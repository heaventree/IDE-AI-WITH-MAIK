# Integration Compatibility Checklist

## Purpose
This document provides a simple, actionable checklist for verifying compatibility and readiness for integration between the IDE Project Starter and Documentation System.

## Architecture Compatibility

### Data Model Compatibility
- [ ] Project entity structures are compatible
- [ ] User entity structures are compatible
- [ ] Research data model can map to documentation templates

### API Compatibility
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms can be unified
- [ ] API endpoints follow consistent patterns
- [ ] Data formats are compatible (JSON structures)
- [ ] Error handling approaches can be standardized

### Event Communication
- [ ] Event systems can be integrated
- [ ] Event payloads contain necessary information
- [ ] Event consumers can be registered cross-system
- [ ] Event error handling is consistent

## Feature Compatibility

### Research Wizard Integration
- [ ] Research stages map to documentation sections
- [ ] Research data is sufficient for document generation
- [ ] Research wizard UI can link to documentation
- [ ] Research completion can trigger documentation creation

### Documentation System Integration
- [ ] Templates can accept research data inputs
- [ ] Document structure supports research organization
- [ ] Documentation changes can update research status
- [ ] Document versioning works with research iterations

### Cross-System Workflows
- [ ] Navigation between systems is intuitive
- [ ] Context is preserved when switching systems
- [ ] User permissions work consistently
- [ ] Search works across both systems

## Technical Readiness

- [ ] Component styles can be unified
- [ ] Layout approaches work together

### Interaction Patterns
- [ ] Navigation models are compatible
- [ ] Form interactions follow similar patterns
- [ ] Feedback mechanisms are consistent
- [ ] Error presentations are similar

### Accessibility
- [ ] Accessibility standards are compatible
- [ ] Screen reader support is consistent

- [ ] Color contrast standards are aligned

## Security Compatibility

### Authentication
- [ ] Authentication methods can be unified
- [ ] Session management approaches are compatible
- [ ] Token handling is consistent
- [ ] Login/logout flows can be integrated

### Authorization
- [ ] Permission models can be aligned
- [ ] Role definitions are compatible
- [ ] Access control checks work similarly
- [ ] Sensitive data handling is consistent

### Security Standards
- [ ] Security headers can be standardized
- [ ] CSRF protection approaches are compatible
- [ ] Input validation strategies are similar
- [ ] Logging of security events is consistent

## Verification Process

1. Complete initial checklist assessment
2. Identify gaps and incompatibilities
3. Create resolution plan for each gap
4. Implement necessary adaptations
5. Verify checklist items after adaptations
6. Document final compatibility status

## Integration Decision

Based on checklist completion:
- **90-100%**: Proceed with full integration
- **70-89%**: Proceed with caution, address remaining items during integration
- **50-69%**: Address major compatibility issues before proceeding
- **<50%**: Consider alternative integration approach

## Notes

- This checklist should be updated as integration proceeds
- Items can be marked as N/A if not applicable to the specific integration scenario
- Additional custom items can be added based on project-specific requirements
