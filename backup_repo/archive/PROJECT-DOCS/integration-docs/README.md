Changes in either system propagate appropriately, maintaining consistency between research data and documentation.

### 3. Unified Project Dashboard
Single view of project status across research and documentation activities with clear progress tracking.

### 4. Intelligent Template Selection
Automatic recommendation of documentation templates based on project characteristics and research data.

### 5. Documentation Completeness Validation
Verification of documentation against research data to ensure complete coverage of all research insights.

### 6. Integrated Change Management
Tracking and documentation of changes across both research and documentation with clear revision history.
