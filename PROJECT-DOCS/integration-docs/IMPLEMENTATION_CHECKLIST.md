## Verification Process

To complete the verification process:

1. For each item in the checklist:
   - Mark as complete only when fully implemented and tested
   - Add notes for any partial implementations or known issues
   - Link to relevant code or documentation where appropriate

2. Address all incomplete items:
   - Create tasks for any incomplete items
   - Prioritize based on criticality
   - Assign to appropriate team members

3. Final verification:
   - Complete full system test with all integration points
   - Verify user flows across both systems
   - Validate performance metrics
   - Conduct security review
   - Obtain stakeholder sign-off
