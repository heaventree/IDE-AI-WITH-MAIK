# MAIK IDE Handover Document - April 16, 2024

## Project Overview
MAIK IDE (formerly Bolt DIY) is an advanced AI-powered Integrated Development Environment that combines collaborative coding, intelligent code suggestions, and developer productivity tools with a focus on providing a seamless development experience.

## Current State
The project has a fully designed UI framework with consistent theming and styling throughout all components. The UI follows a professional dark-mode-first design inspired by modern IDEs and the NobleUI design system, with semantic color naming and sophisticated component variants.

## Core Components
1. **Layout Structure**
   - MenuBar: Contains app branding, main action buttons, and user tools
   - Sidebar: File explorer, search, git, and collaboration panels
   - Editor: Code editing area with tabbed interface and file icons
   - Terminal: Interactive command-line interface
   - StatusBar: Shows system information and connection status

2. **Theme System**
   - Comprehensive theme with semantic color naming
   - Dark mode by default with light mode option
   - Component-specific variants for consistent styling
   - Custom scrollbars and focus states
   
3. **WebSocket Service**
   - Real-time collaboration infrastructure
   - Message handling system for collaborative editing
   - Connection status monitoring

## Recent Progress (April 16, 2024)
1. Fixed theme variant definitions for:
   - Tab buttons (active and inactive states)
   - Status bar items and layout
   - Editor content styling
   - Sidebar item coloring

2. Added missing theme variants for better component consistency
3. Fixed sidebar styling to ensure consistent colors for file items
4. Fixed duplicate definitions in theme.ts

## Known Issues
1. Sidebar file tree coloring still needs work to ensure consistent styling
2. Some components may not be using the theme variants properly
3. The WebSocket service needs integration with the Editor for real-time code syncing
4. Tab functionality needs refinements for actions like closing tabs

## Next Steps
1. Complete theme implementation across all components
2. Implement file operations (create, open, save)
3. Connect editor to WebSocket service for real-time collaboration
4. Add AI-powered features (code suggestions, debugging assistance)
5. Implement search functionality in sidebar
6. Enhance terminal with more commands

## Notes
- The project is styled using Theme UI with a custom theme system
- WebSocket infrastructure is in place but needs deeper integration
- File explorer is currently using sample data and needs to be connected to actual file system

## Technical Decisions
- Using Theme UI for styling due to its flexibility with themes and variants
- Dark mode as the default with a comprehensive color system
- WebSocket for real-time collaboration to ensure responsive experience
- Modular component architecture to allow for easy extension

## Resources
- Code structure follows standard IDE layout patterns
- Design inspiration from NobleUI theme and Webstudio repository
