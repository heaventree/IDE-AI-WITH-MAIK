## Task Details

### MAIK-001: Design System Implementation

**Description:**
Create a comprehensive design system that enables consistent UI generation across the application. This will serve as the foundation for both manually created and AI-generated UI components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement CSS variables for all core design elements
- Create design tokens for spacing, typography, colors, shadows, and animations
- Develop documentation for the design system
- Ensure all existing components use the design system
- Optimize for AI recognition and usage patterns

**Technical Notes:**
- Research from comparative analysis shows that tools with strong design systems (Webstudio, Tempo) produce more consistent UI
- Post-processing should validate adherence to design system rules
- Consider using CSS Custom Properties with Tailwind for flexible theming
- Design system should be easily serializable for AI context

**Files Affected:**
- `client/src/index.css`
- `client/src/theme.json`
- `client/src/components/ui/*`
- New file: `client/src/lib/designSystem.ts`

### MAIK-002: Component Library Development

**Description:**
Build a comprehensive library of reusable UI components with consistent styling based on the design system. These components will be used throughout the application and serve as templates for AI-generated components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create core component set (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.)
- Ensure all components follow design system principles
- Add proper TypeScript typing for all components
- Implement variants and states for all components
- Document component usage and properties
- Optimize components for AI recognition patterns

**Technical Notes:**
- Components should balance flexibility with consistency
- Include data-attributes for easy recognition by AI systems
- Consider extracting patterns that can be used as generation templates
- Include accessibility features from the start

**Files Affected:**
- `client/src/components/ui/*`
- New directory: `client/src/components/patterns/`

### MAIK-003: UI Code Validation System

**Description:**
Implement a system for validating and improving the quality of AI-generated UI code. This will help ensure consistent code style, prevent common issues, and enforce best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create validation rules for UI component structure
- Implement linting and formatting for generated code
- Add type checking for TypeScript-based components
- Create automatic refactoring suggestions for common issues
- Implement security checks for generated code
- Develop system for measuring and reporting code quality

**Technical Notes:**
- Research indicates this is a critical differentiator between AI IDE tools
- Consider using AST-based validation for deeper structural checking
- Rules should be adaptable based on project context
- Include performance optimization checks

**Files Affected:**
- New directory: `client/src/lib/validation/`
- New file: `client/src/lib/codeQuality.ts`

### MAIK-004: Visual Editor Integration

**Description:**
Create a seamless integration between the visual editor and AI assistance features. This will allow users to visually edit components while leveraging AI for code generation and modifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement visual component manipulation interface
- Create bi-directional sync between visual changes and code
- Add AI assistance for visual editing operations
- Implement context-aware suggestions during visual editing
- Support drag-and-drop functionality for components
- Create visual feedback for AI-suggested changes

**Technical Notes:**
- Research shows tools with combined visual and AI capabilities (Tempo, Webstudio) provide better user experiences
- Visual editor should maintain design system consistency
- Consider using a component tree for structural manipulation
- Implement undo/redo capabilities for both manual and AI changes

**Files Affected:**
- New directory: `client/src/components/visualEditor/`
- `client/src/components/editor/Editor.tsx`
- New file: `client/src/hooks/useVisualEditing.ts`
