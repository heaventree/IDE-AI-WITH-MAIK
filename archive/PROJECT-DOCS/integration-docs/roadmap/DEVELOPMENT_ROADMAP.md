#### 2. Data Model Incompatibility
- **Risk**: Fundamental data model differences complicate integration
- **Impact**: Compromised data integrity, complex synchronization
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive data model analysis early, adapter pattern implementation, clear migration plan

#### 3. Performance Degradation
- **Risk**: Integration causes performance issues
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, reduced adoption
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing throughout development, optimization phase, scalable architecture design

#### 4. User Adoption Resistance
- **Risk**: Users resist workflow changes
- **Impact**: Reduced productivity, negative feedback
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: User involvement in design, comprehensive training, phased rollout, feedback mechanisms

#### 5. Security Vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Integration introduces security issues
- **Impact**: Data breaches, compliance violations
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Security review at each phase, penetration testing, compliance validation
