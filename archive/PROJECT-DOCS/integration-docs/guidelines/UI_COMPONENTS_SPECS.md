## Implementation Guidelines

### Technical Requirements

- **Framework Compatibility**:
  - Components must work with React 18+
  - TypeScript type definitions required
  - Compatible with both systems' state management
- **Performance**:
  - Lazy-loading for complex visualizations
  - Efficient re-rendering (use memoization)
  - Animations optimized for 60fps
- **Responsiveness**:
  - All components must adapt to containers
  - Mobile-first design approach
  - Breakpoint consistency with existing systems

### Design System Integration

- **Typography**:
  - Use existing typography scale from Documentation System
  - Headings: Source Sans Pro (semi-bold)
  - Body: Source Sans Pro (regular)
  - Code: Fira Mono
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: #3498db (Documentation System blue)
  - Secondary: #2c3e50 (IDE Project Starter dark blue)
  - Accent: #e74c3c (for attention indicators)
  - Use existing color variables from both systems
- **Spacing**:
  - Follow 8px grid system
  - Consistent padding (16px for containers, 8px for related elements)
  - Maintain component density matching existing systems

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Compliance Standards**:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
  - WAI-ARIA 1.1 pattern implementation
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)
  - Keyboard navigation verification
  - Color contrast verification
- **Specific Considerations**:
  - Animation must respect reduced motion preferences
  - Interactive elements must have appropriate focus states
  - Status changes must be announced to screen readers

## Component Development Process

1. **Design Review**:
   - Component designs must be reviewed against these specifications
   - Variations and states must be defined before implementation

2. **Implementation**:
   - Start with accessibility-first approach
   - Implement core functionality before animations
   - Create comprehensive Storybook stories for all states

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for component logic
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Accessibility testing with automated tools and manual verification

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create component API documentation
   - Include example usage code
   - Document integration points with both systems

## Next Steps

- Develop component prototypes for initial review
- Create shared component library repository
- Establish component governance process
- Implement highest priority components first:
  1. Document Insights Widget
  2. Documentation Flow Progress
  3. Cross-System Context Tooltip
