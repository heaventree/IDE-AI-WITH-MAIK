# MAIK-AI-CODING-APP Remediation Project Handover

## Project Status Overview
**Date:** April 17, 2025  
**Team:** Documentation and Infrastructure Team  
**Current Phase:** Documentation and Planning Phase

## Work Completed

### ✓ Documentation System Implementation
- Implemented comprehensive documentation system with template-based generation
- Created and populated `maik_ai_coding_app_variables.json` with project variables
- Generated core documentation across multiple domains (architecture, security, development workflow)
- Added detailed task tracking and agent handover documentation
- Implemented AI integration documentation with service descriptions

### ✓ System Renaming and Migration
- Completed rebranding from "Bolt DIY" to "MAIK-AI-CODING-APP"
- Updated all relevant documentation to reflect the new brand identity
- Ensured consistent naming throughout documentation

### ✓ Core Architecture Planning
- Analyzed existing architecture and identified remediation needs
- Created blueprint for new architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Established interfaces for core components (MemoryManager, StateManager, etc.)
- Designed error handling system with monitoring integration
- Prepared for dependency injection implementation

### ✓ Task Planning
- Created comprehensive task list with prioritization
- Established clear assignment of responsibilities
- Defined dependencies between tasks
- Created debugging tasks for identified issues

## Blueprint Implementation Plan

We are working from the "MAIK-AI-CODING-APP: Remediation & Refactoring Blueprint Document Version 2.1" which outlines the architectural approach and implementation steps. The blueprint is organized into the following key sections:

1. **Core Architecture & Error Handling**
   - Agent class with dependency injection
   - ErrorHandler implementation with monitoring
   - Interface definitions for core components
   - Testing infrastructure

2. **Advanced Memory Implementation**
   - Hybrid memory system (short-term buffer + vector store)
   - Memory summarization and retrieval
   - Context optimization for token efficiency

3. **Prompt Engineering & Optimization**
   - Template-based prompt system
   - Token usage optimization
   - Dynamic context inclusion

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Request lifecycle tracking
   - Token usage monitoring
   - Integration with observability tools

5. **AI Governance & Safety**
   - Bias detection
   - Content filtering
   - Decision logging
   - Transparency features

6. **Tool Integration Framework**
   - Tool registry system
   - JSON schema validation
   - Structured execution framework

## Next Steps

The next phase of implementation should focus on:

1. **Core Architecture Implementation**
   - Start with ErrorHandler and monitoring integration
   - Implement interfaces for all core components
   - Set up dependency injection container
   - Create base Agent class implementation

2. **Memory Manager Implementation**
   - Implement hybrid memory approach as outlined in blueprint
   - Add vector search capabilities
   - Ensure proper context optimization for tokens

3. **Prompt Management System**
   - Create template-based prompt system
   - Implement dynamic context windowing
   - Add prompt versioning support

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Type Compatibility with Sentry SDK**
   - Current Sentry integration has type compatibility warnings
   - Issue is documented in the agent handover document

2. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - State management needs optimization for production use
   - Current implementation may have potential memory leaks

3. **Token Efficiency**
   - Token usage optimization still pending implementation
   - Need to implement context windowing properly

## Resources and References

1. **Blueprint Document**
   - Full blueprint is available at `attached_assets/Pasted-Bolt-DIY-Remediation-Refactoring-BlueprintDocument-Version-2-1-Incorporates-v2-1-structure-tab-1744903810003.txt`
   - Use this as the primary reference for implementation

2. **Documentation System**
   - All generated documentation is in `docs-system/docs/`
   - Templates are in `docs-system/templates/`
   - Variables are in `docs-system/maik_ai_coding_app_variables.json`

3. **Core Architecture**
   - Initial implementation examples in `core/` directory
   - Refer to `core/error-handler.ts` and `core/agent/state-manager.ts` for examples

## Conclusion

The documentation phase has established a solid foundation for the remediation project. The next team should focus on implementing the core architecture components based on the blueprint document, starting with the error handling system and dependency injection setup, then moving on to the memory management and prompt optimization systems.

The blueprint document provides detailed guidance on implementation approaches, testing strategies, and performance considerations that should be closely followed. Any deviations from the blueprint should be documented with clear rationales.
