# Backend Development Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines the standard backend development patterns used in {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Following these patterns ensures consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the codebase.

## Architectural Patterns

### Service-Oriented Architecture

{{PROJECT_NAME}} follows a service-oriented architecture with the following characteristics:

- **Service Boundaries**: Clearly defined boundaries between different functional domains
- **Service Contracts**: Well-documented interfaces for service interactions
- **Service Autonomy**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently

### Repository Pattern

Data access is implemented using the Repository pattern:

- **Repositories**: Abstract data access logic behind a collection-like interface
- **Entity Models**: Represent domain objects with behavior and validation
- **Data Mappers**: Transform between persistence models and domain models

### Dependency Injection

The application uses dependency injection to:

- Decouple components
- Facilitate testing
- Enable configuration of dependencies
- Support different implementations for different environments

## API Design

### RESTful Principles

APIs follow RESTful design principles:

- Resource-oriented endpoints
- Appropriate use of HTTP methods
- Consistent response structures
- Proper status code usage

### Versioning Strategy

API versioning follows these guidelines:

- {{API_VERSIONING_STRATEGY}}
- Version included in URL path or accept header
- Backwards compatibility maintained where possible
- Clear deprecation policies

### Request Validation

All API requests are validated:

- Input validation at the API boundary
- Schema-based validation for request payloads
- Consistent error responses for validation failures

## Error Handling

### Error Types

The system distinguishes between different types of errors:

- **Validation Errors**: Invalid input from the client
- **Authentication/Authorization Errors**: Permission or identity issues
- **Business Logic Errors**: Valid requests that cannot be fulfilled due to business rules
- **System Errors**: Unexpected internal failures

### Error Responses

Error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "userId",
        "issue": "User with ID 12345 does not exist"
      }
    ],
    "requestId": "req-123456"
  }
}
```

### Error Logging

Error logging follows these principles:

- All errors are logged with appropriate context
- Log levels match error severity
- PII is properly redacted from logs
- Distributed tracing IDs included for correlation

## Asynchronous Processing

### Message Queuing

Asynchronous operations use message queues:

- Decoupling of producers and consumers
- Retry policies for failed operations
- Dead letter queues for irrecoverable failures
- Monitoring of queue health and backlog

### Background Jobs

Background processing follows these patterns:

- Scheduled jobs managed through a centralized scheduler
- Idempotent job implementations
- Job status tracking and visibility
- Graceful handling of interruptions

## Data Access

### Query Optimization

Database queries follow these optimization guidelines:

- Indexes designed for common query patterns
- Query performance monitored and optimized
- N+1 query problems avoided
- Connection pooling configured appropriately

### Transactions

Transactions are managed following these principles:

- Transaction boundaries clearly defined
- Appropriate isolation levels selected
- Deadlock prevention strategies implemented
- Long-running transactions avoided

## Security Patterns

### Authentication

Authentication follows these patterns:

- Token-based authentication
- Secure credential storage
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management best practices

### Authorization

Authorization implements these patterns:

- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- Permission checks enforced at service boundaries
- Regular authorization audits

### Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected using:

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data minimization principles
- Access auditing for sensitive operations
- Secure data erasure procedures

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Unit tests follow these guidelines:

- Tests isolated from external dependencies
- Mocking frameworks used appropriately
- Test coverage metrics maintained
- Fast execution time

### Integration Testing

Integration tests implement:

- Service boundaries tested
- Database interactions verified
- External service mocks or test doubles
- Environment-specific configurations

### Contract Testing

API contracts are verified through:

- Consumer-driven contract tests
- Schema validation
- Backwards compatibility checks
- Automated contract verification in CI

## Code Structure

### Module Organization

Backend code is organized into the following structure:

```
src/
  domain/          # Business entities and logic
  application/     # Application services and use cases
  infrastructure/  # External interfaces, persistence, etc.
  interface/       # API controllers, event handlers, etc.
  config/          # Application configuration
test/
  unit/            # Unit tests
  integration/     # Integration tests
  contract/        # API contract tests
```

### Naming Conventions

The codebase follows these naming conventions:

- **Files**: PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for modules
- **Classes**: PascalCase, noun phrases
- **Methods**: camelCase, verb phrases
- **Variables**: camelCase, descriptive names
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

The caching strategy includes:

- Multi-level caching (memory, distributed)
- Cache invalidation patterns
- TTL policies based on data volatility
- Cache penetration protection

### Resource Management

Resources are managed following these principles:

- Connection pooling for external services
- Resource cleanup in failure cases
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Rate limiting for fair resource allocation

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging

Logging follows these practices:

- Structured logging format (JSON)
- Consistent log levels across services
- Contextual information included
- PII and sensitive data filtered

### Metrics

The following metrics are tracked:

- Request rates and latencies
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization
- Business-specific KPIs

### Tracing

Distributed tracing implements:

- Correlation IDs propagated across service boundaries
- Span collection for performance analysis
- Sampling strategies for high-volume services
- Integration with observability platforms

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

Code is documented following these standards:

- Public APIs fully documented
- Complex algorithms explained
- Business rules referenced
- Code comments focus on "why" not "what"

### API Documentation

APIs are documented using:

- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Example requests and responses
- Error scenarios documented
- Authentication requirements specified
