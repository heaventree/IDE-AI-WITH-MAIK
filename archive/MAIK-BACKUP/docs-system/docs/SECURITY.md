# MAIK-AI-CODING-APP - Security Guidelines

## Overview

MAIK-AI-CODING-APP implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and ensure secure AI operations. Security is integrated at every level of the application, from authentication and authorization to data protection and compliance with regulations.

## Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal access required for functionality
- **Secure by Default**: Start with secure configurations
- **Privacy by Design**: Incorporate privacy throughout the development process
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and systems up to date
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activities and vulnerabilities

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Strategy

- **Method**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with secure, HttpOnly cookies
- **Session Management**: Stateless JWT authentication with expiration and refresh tokens
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 12 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factors.
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Optional Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for high-privilege accounts

### Authorization Model

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Role-based access control with predefined roles including User, Developer, Administrator, and System
- **Permission Structure**: Hierarchical permissions grouped by resource types and actions (create, read, update, delete)
- **Access Control Implementation**: Middleware-based authorization checks at API routes and component-level access control in the UI

### Implementation Guidelines

```javascript
// Example authentication implementation
```typescript
const authenticate = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.cookies.authToken;
    if (!token) throw new AuthError('Authentication required');
    
    const decoded = verifyJWT(token);
    req.user = await userService.getById(decoded.userId);
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication failed' });
  }
};
```
