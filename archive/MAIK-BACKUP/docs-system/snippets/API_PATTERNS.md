# API Patterns

This document outlines common API design patterns, best practices, and implementation guidelines.

## RESTful API Design

### Core Principles

1. **Resource-Oriented**: APIs are organized around resources.
2. **HTTP Methods**: Use standard HTTP methods appropriately.
3. **Statelessness**: Requests contain all information needed to process them.
4. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent, standardized resource identifiers and methods.
5. **HATEOAS** (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State): API responses include links to related resources.

### HTTP Methods

| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe |
|--------|---------|------------|------|
| GET | Retrieve resources | Yes | Yes |
| POST | Create new resources | No | No |
| PUT | Replace resources | Yes | No |
| PATCH | Partially update resources | No* | No |
| DELETE | Remove resources | Yes | No |
| OPTIONS | Get supported methods | Yes | Yes |
| HEAD | Get headers only | Yes | Yes |

*PATCH can be made idempotent depending on implementation.
