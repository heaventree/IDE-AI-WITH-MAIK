# Documentation System

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE FOR ALL AI AGENTS ⚠️

### [🚨 CLICK HERE TO OPEN THE DOCUMENTATION TASK MANAGER](/task_manager.html)

**ATTENTION ALL AI AGENTS:** You MUST use the Documentation Task Manager to complete any documentation tasks. This is a mandatory system that guides you through the documentation process step-by-step.

**DO NOT proceed without using the Task Manager first!**

---

## Overview

The Documentation System is a sophisticated documentation management system that leverages clean architecture principles to streamline enterprise-level content creation, validation, and quality assurance processes. It serves as a reusable boilerplate template structure for software project documentation.

## Purpose

This system provides:

1. **Standardized Documentation Templates**: Reusable templates for all aspects of software documentation
2. **Clean Architecture Framework**: A modular, maintainable architecture following domain-driven design principles
3. **Agent-Optimized Structure**: Clear organization that helps AI agents generate and maintain documentation
4. **Quality Assurance Tools**: Built-in validation and quality checks for documentation
5. **Workflows**: Structured processes for document creation, review, and publication
6. **Task Management System**: Step-by-step guidance for documentation tasks

## Getting Started

### For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent working with this system:

1. **FIRST:** Use the [Documentation Task Manager](/task_manager.html) - this is MANDATORY
2. Next, read the [Agent Initialization Guide](/agent/agent_init.md)
3. Review the [Agent Roles](/agent/roles.md) to understand your responsibilities
4. Follow the [Commit Format Guidelines](/docs/commit-format.md) for version control
5. Use the established [Placeholder Syntax](/templates/README.md#placeholder-syntax) for incomplete sections

### For Human Users

If you're a human user of this system:

1. Browse the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) to understand the system organization
2. Check the [Templates](/templates/) for standardized document formats
3. View the [Documentation Guidelines](/docs/documentation_guidelines.md) for best practices
4. Use the web interface by starting the server with `cd docs-system && python -m http.server 5000`

## Key Features

- **Document Management**: Create, update, and publish documents
- **Version Control**: Track and manage document versions
- **Workflow Management**: Manage document workflows from creation to publication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through domain events
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all layers
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling across the system

## Architecture

The system follows clean architecture principles with distinct layers:

1. **Core Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, and domain logic
2. **Application Layer**: Contains application services, use cases, and DTOs
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains implementations of repositories, services, and external integrations
4. **Interfaces Layer**: Contains API routes, controllers, and UI components

## Development Guidelines

When extending or modifying the Documentation System:

1. **Follow Clean Architecture**: Keep concerns separated between layers
2. **Use Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the domain model and business rules
3. **Maintain Modularity**: Ensure components are loosely coupled
4. **Write Tests**: Cover critical functionality with tests
5. **Update Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## Contributing

Contributions to the Documentation System should:

1. Follow the established architecture and patterns
2. Include appropriate documentation updates
3. Adhere to the commit message format
4. Pass all existing tests and include new tests as needed
5. Be reviewed by the appropriate agent role owner
