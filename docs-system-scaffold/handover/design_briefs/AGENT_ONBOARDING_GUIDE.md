# Agent Onboarding Guide
**CRITICAL: READ THIS DOCUMENT FIRST**

## Key Principle: Zero Prior Knowledge Assumption

This project operates on the principle of **assuming total and complete ignorance** of what has gone before. This means:

1. **DO NOT assume any prior knowledge** of the project, its structure, or its implementation
2. **DO NOT skip reading any documentation**, even if you think you understand the project
3. **DO NOT make assumptions** about how things work based on familiarity with similar systems
4. **ALWAYS follow the documented processes** exactly as specified

## Required First Steps (in this exact order)

1. **READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT** before proceeding
2. **NAVIGATE to [/docs-system/task_manager.html](/docs-system/task_manager.html)**
3. **COMPLETE ALL DOCUMENTATION TASKS** as guided by the Task Manager
4. **READ the complete design brief** for your specific project/task
5. **VERIFY your understanding** by reviewing all referenced files and systems

## Strict Documentation Rules

* **ALL work must be documented** in real-time as you proceed
* **ALL files must be created in the designated locations**
* **NEVER create files outside the docs-system directory**
* **ALWAYS update documentation BEFORE implementing changes**
* **ALWAYS complete ALL documentation tasks BEFORE considering your work complete**

## Documentation Task Manager System

The **Task Manager** ([/docs-system/task_manager.html](/docs-system/task_manager.html)) is the **ONLY** authorized system for managing documentation tasks. It:

1. Provides step-by-step guidance for all documentation requirements
2. Ensures all required files are created in the correct locations
3. Validates documentation content and structure
4. Tracks completion of documentation tasks
5. Prevents documentation gaps and inconsistencies

## Project Structure Fundamentals

All documentation MUST be organized within these structural guidelines:

1. `/docs-system/` - Main documentation system files
   - `/templates/` - Template files for different documentation types
   - `/snippets/` - Reusable content snippets 
   - `/handover/` - Project handover documentation
     - `/design_briefs/` - In-depth project design information
   - `/architecture/` - Architectural design documentation
   - Other appropriate subdirectories for specific documentation needs

**Critical Warning:** Creating files outside these structures will result in them being inaccessible to the documentation system and requiring complete rework.

## Documentation First Principle

This system operates on a **documentation-first principle**, meaning:

1. Documentation is NOT an afterthought - it is the PRIMARY deliverable
2. Code implementation FOLLOWS documentation, not the other way around
3. Documentation MUST be comprehensive enough for a completely new agent to understand the entire system

## Complete Context Requirement

Each document MUST provide complete context, assuming the reader has NO prior knowledge of:
- The project's purpose
- The technologies used
- The implementation details
- The business requirements
- Previous development history

## Where to Get Help

If you're uncertain about any aspect of the documentation process:

1. Review the Task Manager instructions again
2. Consult the specific design brief for your project
3. Check the documentation templates for guidance
4. Look for example documentation in similar projects
5. Ask for clarification before proceeding with assumptions

Remember: No prior knowledge is assumed, so thorough documentation is essential for all aspects of the project.
