# Project Design Brief: Documentation System

## Project Fundamentals

**Project Name:** Documentation System Integration
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** April 17, 2025

## Core Project Description

### Purpose & Vision
This project aims to integrate an IDE Project Starter App with a Documentation System to create a comprehensive tool for project kickstarting, research, and documentation management. The vision is to provide a seamless, integrated experience that guides agents through the documentation process with explicit, step-by-step instructions that ensure complete and consistent documentation across projects.

The system serves as a sophisticated backbone feature for a forked version of Bolt DIY, leveraging existing UI components while adding new functionality for documentation management. This integration creates a holistic environment where documentation is treated as a first-class citizen in the development process.

### Business Objectives
- Create a self-contained, integrated system that forces proper documentation completion
- Provide highly detailed, agent-friendly specifications with step-by-step guidance
- Package the system for easy deployment in other container environments
- Design for agents with "total and complete ignorance" of previous work
- Reduce time spent on documentation review and correction
- Eliminate inconsistencies in documentation across different projects
- Ensure comprehensive knowledge transfer between different teams/agents

### Target Audience
- AI Agents with no prior knowledge of the system
- Human developers requiring comprehensive project documentation
- Project managers overseeing documentation completeness
- QA teams verifying documentation accuracy
- Stakeholders requiring high-level project understanding
- Future developers who need to maintain or extend the system

## Core Architecture & Components

### System Architecture Overview
The system follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer**: UI components for interacting with the documentation system
2. **Application Layer**: Task management system that orchestrates the documentation process
3. **Domain Layer**: Core documentation models and business logic
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Storage and integration points with external systems

The system is designed as a web application with both server-side and client-side components. The server handles API requests and serves static files, while the client provides an interactive interface for documentation management.

### Key Components
1. **Documentation Task Manager**
   - Core component that guides agents through documentation tasks
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for creating and updating documentation
   - Validates documentation completeness and structure
   - Tracks progress and completion of documentation tasks

2. **Documentation Templates**
   - Standardized templates for different types of documentation
   - Variables system for customizing templates for specific projects
   - Validation rules for ensuring template completeness

3. **Agent Guidance System**
   - Clear instructions for agents on using the system
   - Role-specific guidance for different types of agents
   - Error handling and recovery procedures

4. **Handover Management**
   - Design brief templates and examples
   - Project-specific documentation for knowledge transfer
   - Transition guides for new agents

5. **Integration Points**
   - API endpoints for programmatic access to documentation
   - File system integration for storing and retrieving documentation
   - Web interface for interactive access

### Data Model & Flow
The system operates on several key data entities:

1. **Documentation Tasks**
   - Task ID, name, description, status, completion criteria
   - Dependencies on other tasks
   - Assignment to specific roles/agents

2. **Documentation Templates**
   - Template ID, name, type, content structure
   - Required and optional sections
   - Variables and placeholders

3. **Project Variables**
   - Variable name, value, scope
   - Default values and validation rules
   - Usage context

4. **Handover Documents**
   - Document ID, type, content
   - Version history
   - Approval status

Data flows through the system in this sequence:
1. Task Manager loads tasks from configuration
2. Agent selects or is assigned tasks
3. System provides templates and guidance for selected tasks
4. Agent populates templates with project-specific information
5. System validates documentation completeness
6. Completed documentation is stored and made available for review

## Technical Implementation Details

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js (v20.x)
- **Server**: Express.js (v4.x)
- **Storage**: File system (JSON-based)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
- **API**: RESTful design pattern
- **Packaging**: Bash scripts for creating self-contained distributions

### Integration Points
- **IDE Project Starter App**: Integration via shared file system and APIs
- **File System**: For storing documentation files and templates

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Principle of least privilege for file system access
- Regular security audits and updates

## Development & Agent Guidelines

### Development Approach
- Documentation-first development methodology
- Iterative enhancement of the documentation system
- Clear separation of concerns following clean architecture principles
- Focus on simplicity and clarity for agent understanding
- Comprehensive testing of all components
- Continuous integration of documentation with code

### Key Constraints & Requirements
- All documentation MUST be created within the docs-system directory
- The Task Manager MUST be used for all documentation tasks
- Documentation MUST assume "total and complete ignorance" from agents
- The system MUST be packaged for easy deployment in other environments
- All changes MUST be additive rather than destructive
- The system MUST guide agents step-by-step through file processing and validation
- There MUST be ONE main infrastructure with all tools and files accessible to both humans and machines

### Agent Role-Specific Guidance

**For Design Architects:**
- Focus on maintaining clean architecture principles
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Create comprehensive diagrams for system components
- Ensure documentation includes both high-level and detailed views
- Validate architecture against business requirements

**For Integration Specialists:**
- Document all API endpoints and their usage
- Create detailed integration guides for external systems
- Test and validate all integration points
- Document error handling and recovery procedures
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems

**For QA & Testing:**
- Verify documentation completeness and accuracy
- Test all examples and code snippets
- Validate that documentation matches implementation
- Create test cases for documentation scenarios
- Ensure documentation covers error cases and edge conditions

## Business Rules & Logic

### Core Business Rules
1. All documentation tasks MUST be completed in order of dependencies
2. Documentation MUST be validated before being considered complete
3. Templates MUST be followed exactly as specified
4. All variables MUST be replaced with actual values
5. Documentation MUST be created in the specified locations
6. The Task Manager is the single source of truth for task status
7. Documentation MUST be complete before implementation begins

### Critical Workflows
1. **Agent Onboarding:**
   - Agent reads onboarding guide
   - Agent navigates to Task Manager
   - Agent completes documentation tasks in sequence
   - System validates task completion
   - Agent proceeds to implementation only after documentation is complete

2. **Documentation Creation:**
   - System provides template for specific documentation type
   - Agent populates template with project-specific information
   - System validates documentation completeness
   - Agent updates documentation based on validation feedback
   - System marks documentation as complete

3. **Project Handover:**
   - Outgoing agent completes design brief
   - System validates design brief completeness
   - Incoming agent reads design brief
   - Incoming agent completes onboarding process
   - Knowledge transfer is validated through documentation review

### Decision Points & Logic
1. **Task Assignment Decision:**
   - IF agent role matches task requirements
   - THEN assign task to agent
   - ELSE provide guidance on proper role for the task

2. **Documentation Validation Logic:**
   - IF all required sections are complete
   - AND all variables are replaced
   - AND all validation rules pass
   - THEN mark documentation as complete
   - ELSE provide specific feedback on missing/invalid elements

3. **Template Selection Logic:**
   - IF project type matches template category
   - THEN provide specific template
   - ELSE provide general template with customization guidance

## Deployment & Operations

### Deployment Architecture
The system is designed to be deployed in various environments:

1. **Development Environment:**
   - Local Node.js server
   - File system-based storage
   - No authentication required

2. **Production Environment:**
   - Containerized deployment (Docker or similar)
   - Optional persistent storage volume
   - Authentication and authorization required
   - HTTPS with proper certificates

3. **Packaging for Distribution:**
   - Self-contained tarball with all necessary files
   - Verification scripts for checking installation integrity
   - Automated setup script for quick deployment

### Operational Considerations
- Regular backups of documentation repository
- Version control for documentation files
- Monitoring of system availability and performance
- Scalability for large documentation repositories
- Disaster recovery procedures
- User support and training materials
- Regular updates and security patches
