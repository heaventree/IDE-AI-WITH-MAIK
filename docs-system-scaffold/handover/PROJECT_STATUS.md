## Core Implementation Principles

### UI-First Development Approach
**CRITICAL: UI DEVELOPMENT MUST COME FIRST**

For all features and projects, UI development MUST be prioritized before implementing any functional code. This is a non-negotiable principle of our development approach.

- The appropriate UI must be designed and implemented first
- No functional code should be written until the UI is in place
- UI selection should align with the project's end goals (SaaS, Admin Tool, etc.)
- Base UI kits should be used as specified in the [UI Kit Selection Guide](/handover/UI_KIT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md)

### Implementation Priorities

#### Current Sprint (April 17-24, 2025)

1. **Task Manager UI Enhancements (HIGHEST)**
   - Status: Not Started
   - Implementation: Redesign Task Manager UI with improved user experience
   - Files: `/docs-system/task_manager.html`, `/docs-system/css/`
   - [Complete details in Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md#task-0-task-manager-ui-enhancements)

2. **File Preview in Task Manager (HIGH)**
   - Status: Not Started
   - Implementation: Add tab in task manager UI with file preview panel
   - Files: `/docs-system/task_manager.html`, `/docs-system/server.js`
   - [Complete details in Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md#task-1-add-file-content-preview-in-task-manager)

3. **Documentation Tracking Enhancements (HIGH)**
   - Status: Not Started
   - Implementation: Add visual progress indicators and persistent tracking
   - Files: `/docs-system/agent/documentation_manager.js`, `/docs-system/task_manager.html`
   - [Complete details in Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md#task-2-implement-documentation-completion-tracking)

### Upcoming (Next Sprint)

1. **Documentation Export Functionality**
   - Status: Planned
   - Implementation: Add export to PDF, HTML, Markdown
   - [Complete details in Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md#task-4-implement-documentation-export-functionality)

2. **Placeholder Suggestion System**
   - Status: Planned
   - Implementation: Intelligent suggestions for placeholders
   - [Complete details in Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md#task-5-implement-placeholder-suggestion-system)

## Architecture & Key Components

### Core System Components
- **Server (`/docs-system/server.js`)**: HTTP server with API endpoints and static file serving
- **Documentation Manager (`/docs-system/agent/documentation_manager.js`)**: Core logic for documentation tasks
- **Task Manager UI (`/docs-system/task_manager.html`)**: Web interface for documentation tasks
- **Placeholder Utility (`/docs-system/agent/placeholder_util.js`)**: Handles variable substitution in templates

### Key Directory Structure
- `/docs-system/agent/`: Core system logic and task definitions
- `/docs-system/templates/`: Documentation templates
- `/docs-system/handover/`: Handover process and completed handovers
- `/docs-system/handover/design_briefs/`: Design information for projects
- `/docs-system/architecture/`: System architecture documentation

## Getting Started

### For New Agents (Onboarding)
1. Start with [START_HERE.md](/START_HERE.md) in the root docs-system directory
2. Access the [Task Manager](/task_manager.html) to view current tasks
3. Review the [Implementation Priorities](/handover/IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md) for detailed task specifications
4. Read the latest entry in [Project Status](/handover/PROJECT_STATUS.md) (this document)

### For Departing Agents (Offboarding)
1. Update this document with your latest progress
2. Ensure all implemented features are documented
3. Add any new issues or challenges encountered
4. Update the Implementation Priorities with current status
5. Create a detailed handover in `/docs-system/handover/completed/` using the template

## Known Issues & Challenges

### Open Issues
- Directory navigation could be improved with breadcrumbs
- Task Manager UI needs mobile-responsive design
- Documentation validation needs more comprehensive rules
- No user authentication/authorization system yet

### Technical Debt
- Placeholder substitution system needs refactoring for better performance
- Error handling should be more consistent across the codebase
- Need more comprehensive test coverage
- Some hard-coded values should be moved to configuration
